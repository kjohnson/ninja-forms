== Description ==
Ninja Forms is a full-featured form building solution for WordPress. It allows you to easily and quickly design complex forms through a drag and drop interface.

= Some of the cool features of Ninja Forms: =

* Custom input masks allow you to restrict user input for things like phone numbers, currency, and dates.
* Manage, Edit, and Export user submissions.
* Save fields as favorites and re-use them in multiple forms.
* Export and Import forms and favorite fields.
* Set required fields.
* Add a datepicker to text fields.
* Email form results to any number of pre-determined email addresses, as well as specific messages to the user filling out the form.
* Extremely developer friendly.

= In addition to these features, extensions are available at our website: [Ninja Forms Extensions](http://wpninjas.com/downloads/category/ninja-forms/) =

* File Uploads - Allow users to upload files and store those files within a searchable database.
* Multi-Part Forms - Break up those long, complex forms into multiple pages.
* Save User Progress - Let your users save their progress and return later to finish filling out the form.
* Conditional Logic - Create "smart" forms that show or hide fields based upon user input. Even add a value to a dropdown list when a user selects a specific value from another list.
* Front-End Posting - Use Ninja Forms to create posts from the front-end. These can be added to any post type, including custom post types, and users can select categories and tags.

We have several other extensions in the works.
